# Interstellar-Factory-Tycoon
Game Overview:
Interstellar Factory Tycoon is a massive multiplayer online real-time strategy (MMORTS) game where players mine materials from planets, refine them, and build factories to produce various products. Players can research new technologies to improve their factories, smelters, and mining machines. The game begins in a solar system with four planets and expands as players discover new technologies that enable them to warp to other solar systems. To progress in new solar systems, players need to trade products on the market with other players.

Core Features:
